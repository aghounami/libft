    Libft - Your Very First Own Library

Welcome to Libft, your very first own C library! This project is part of [insert name of your curriculum or course here], where you'll learn to code a collection of general-purpose functions that you'll frequently use in your future C projects.
Overview

Libft is a library consisting of various functions that replicate some standard functions in C's libc library as well as additional functions that you'll find useful in your programming journey. The project is structured into mandatory and bonus parts, each containing a set of functions you need to implement.
Contents

    Introduction: An overview of the project, its purpose, and how it fits into your learning journey.
    Common Instructions: General guidelines and requirements for the project, including coding standards, memory management, and submission instructions.
    Mandatory Part: Details on the mandatory functions you need to implement, their prototypes, descriptions, and any external functions you're allowed to use.
    Bonus Part: Information on the bonus functions, including the requirements for their implementation and how they contribute to your project's completeness.
    Submission and Peer-Evaluation: Instructions on how to submit your work and what to expect during the evaluation process.
